## BLEACH 

** ICHIGO KUROSAKI ** 
* This is my favorite movie because Bleach is often seen as the weakest of the "big three" of shonen anime for many valid reasons, much to the chagrin of its fans. The classic big three of shonen anime are Eiichiro Oda's One Piece, Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto, and Tite Kubo's Bleach. *
